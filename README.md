**Project Summary:**

This project involves employing advanced data analytics techniques to delve into the intricacies of restaurants and customer feedback on the widely-used online food delivery platform, Zomato.

The dataset encompasses a range of information, including restaurant names, locations, cuisines, average cost for two, ratings, and user reviews.

We will be looking after the crucial task of data cleaning and preprocessing. Eliminating duplicate entries, addressing missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis.

Moving forward, we will implement clustering on the restaurant data using the k-means algorithm. The aim will be to group similar restaurants together and uncover underlying patterns within the dataset.

The findings generated from this analysis will have the potential to provide valuable guidance to both restaurants and customers in making informed decisions. Moreover, the project could be extended to other cities or countries to explore eating habits and preferences across different regions.

**Problem Statement:**

The objective of this project is to delve into the dynamics of the restaurant industry in India through an analysis of data sourced from Zomato, a leading restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up.

This endeavor seeks to extract insights from customer reviews, segment Zomato restaurants into distinct categories, and draw meaningful conclusions through visualization techniques.

By examining data pertaining to cuisine, pricing, and customer feedback, the project aims to facilitate informed decision-making for both customers seeking the best dining experiences and the company seeking opportunities for growth and enhancement within the industry.

Furthermore, the project endeavors to conduct sentiment analysis and identify influential critics within the industry based on reviewer metadata.
